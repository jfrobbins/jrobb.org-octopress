Today I had planned to do the task of dropping the rear suspension, which <em>should</em> have been pretty easy compared to the front.  Turned out, it was not destined to be that way.

 <ul>
<li>removed driveshaft</li>
<li>removed brake lines</li>
<li>removed e-brake lines</li>
<li>wheels off</li>
<li>unbolt the u-bolts</li>
<li>unbolt springs</li>
<li>done</li>
</ul>
That's how it <strong>should</strong> have gone, anyway.  And I guess it did, for the most part, however it ended up taking me most of the day to finish this.  The hangups were at the brake line removal (that has always been rather stubborn), and then one of the leaf spring frame mounts was STUCK.  Just so happened, this was the very last bolt on the whole shebang.  I ended up having to cut the bolt off from both sides, with a lot of hammering and prying, but I finally got the spring out.  I then put the wheels back on just so it's sitting up on something, but the only thing holding the jeep up right now are 4 jack stands.

 One day this week I am going to pick up a completely rebuil dana 30 axle geared 4.88:1, and also a guy is coming to buy my 3.5" lift springs.  Next step will be to buy some 1.5"-ish lift springs, and prep these axles for new perches and shock mounts.

 Some pics of the updated progress:

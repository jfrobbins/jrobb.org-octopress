These are my favorite Linux distributions.  They are definitely subject to change!

 <ol>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/arch" target="_blank">Arch</a> I love this one, I've been using it for a couple of years now.</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/fedora" target="_blank">Fedora</a>  I like Fedora a lot--I've been using it on a couple of PCs here lately.</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/crunchbang" target="_blank">CrunchBang</a>  I liked this one a lot the last time I tried it, and apparently now it is based off Debian instead of Ubuntu.  I run this on my eeePC</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/sabayon" target="_blank">Sabayon</a>  although a bit bloated on the default ISO, this distro and I really got along, and the community was top-notch.</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/pardus" target="_blank">Pardus</a>  this is definitely another good one.  I just didnt click with it, but it was quality.</li>
</ol>
A few more that deserve mention as runners up are:

 <ul>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/debian">Debian</a>  the big one.  Ive never cared too much for older packages, even for the sake of stability, but I still have great respect for the distro!</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/mint" target="_blank">Mint</a>  A spin on Ubuntubut a very good spin! (Im usually one for disliking the remixes)</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/ubuntu" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>  itself based on Debian. very polished. I used this one for a long time before hopping and eventually settling down with Arch</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/sidux">sidux</a>  based on Debian sid. I liked this one but not enough to stay with it for very long.</li>
</ul>
Just noticed, it is totally by coincidence, but all of the "runners up" are Debian-based!

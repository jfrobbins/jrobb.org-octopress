so the free server kept crashing due to "upgrades" which will make the service "better"--so far it has only crashed more often.

 factorq.net domain is now back up and running!  I will have to revamp the code section a bit and bring it up to date and all that.  Also I'll have to see if I can get a hold of the posts I had made in between the previous post and this one that had been made on my own server.

 so...woohoo!

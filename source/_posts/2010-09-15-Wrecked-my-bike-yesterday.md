 Yesterday I was coming home from work for lunch, and I downed my motorcycle.  I was actually turning into my neighborhood, so I wasn't going more than 40mph (probably more like &lt;=30), and there was a large section of very fine gravel that I went through...in the turn....as I was downshifting.  Basically it was all my fault, and it should have never happened.  But it did.

 It was a left hand turn, but somehow the bike got slammed to the right.  I was thrown to the ground on my shoulder and head and elbow.  My hip hit shortly thereafter.  And I assume that as I was flung off, my left foot hi the handlebar or something, because my left ankle has a hematoma and is in quite a bit of pain.  My entire right side is very sore today.

 I was wearing my standard gear: helmet (full face), textile jacket,gloves, jeans, racing boots.  If not for these things I would be in a whole new world of hurt.

 I have scratches on my shoulder, and my shirt was torn (yes, even under the padded jacket).

 My elbow has some roadrash, once again through the jacket.

 I mentioned my ankle.

 My helmet has some scratching where it was impacted, and the visor broke off.

 My jeans were torn around the hip/right pocket area, and my DROID which was in that pocket has some scratching on its cover (the backside, luckily).

 So...I'm just really sore today.  Otherwise I am fine.

 This really sucks because I've been trying to sell the dang bike.  doh!

I've installed and been using <a href="http://www.jezra.net/projects/heybuddy" target="_blank">HeyBuddy</a> as a client for <a href="http://identi.ca">identi.ca</a>.  If you don't know what identi.ca is...it's basically an <a href="http://linuxoutlaws.com/explanation/foss" target="_blank">open source</a> <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, with more/better features.

 This thing is great, keeps me from having to use <a href="http://identi.ca/group/mustard" target="_blank">mustard</a> on my droid, or from keeping the webpage open.  <a href="http://status.net" target="_blank">Status.net</a> also has a desktop client, but I do not like it as well.  Besides Heybuddy is "supposedly lightweight," which is always great.

 Check it out if you get the chance.

 Heybuddy exists on <a href="https://launchpad.net/heybuddy">launchpad</a> (which provides .deb and .tar.gz packages) as well as in the <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=37175">ArchLinux AUR</a>. <a href="http://rpm.psquid.net/" target="_blank">Psquid</a> has an RPM available also.

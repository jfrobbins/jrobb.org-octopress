I've been running <a href="http://archlinux.org" target="_blank">ArchLinux</a> on my desktop for a couple of years now, but these days I am getting on that computer less and less.  Little enough that I worry that my infrequency of system updates may cause some breakage.  To-date, I have not had any problems, but it could happen.

 This desktop hosts pictures, and runs ssh, samba, and cups primarily.  So, I was considering hopping to another distro that would possibly be more stable and run for longer periods without a need for manual updates.  After some discussion on <a href="http://identi.ca" target="_blank">identi.ca</a>, I think I will be fine staying with Arch, though--I believe I can still manage to update once a month or so. :-)

 I figure I will go ahead and re-detail my top 5 favorite Linux distros while I'm thinking about it, though. These are in order of my personal preference of use from past distro-hopping adventures:

 <ol>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/arch" target="_blank">Arch</a> ...naturally!</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/crunchbang" target="_blank">CrunchBang</a> - I liked this one a lot the last time I tried it, and apparently now it is based off Debian instead of Ubuntu.</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/sabayon" target="_blank">Sabayon</a> - although a bit bloated on the default ISO, this distro and I really got along, and the community was top-notch.</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/fedora" target="_blank">Fedora</a> - I don't think I really gave fedora the close look it deserved, but I liked what I saw for the brief time that I used it.</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/pardus" target="_blank">Pardus</a> - this is definitely another good one.  I just didn't "click" with it, but it was quality.</li>
</ol>
A few more that deserve mention as runners up are:<!--more-->
<ul>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/debian">Debian</a> - the big one.  I've never cared too much for older packages, even for the sake of stability, but I still have great respect for the distro!</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/mint" target="_blank">Mint</a> - A spin on Ubuntu...but a very good spin! (I'm usually one for disliking the "remixes")</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/ubuntu" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> - itself based on Debian. very polished. I used this one for a long time before hopping and eventually settling down with Arch</li>
<li><a href="http://distrowatch.com/sidux">sidux</a> - based on Debian sid. I liked this one but not enough to stay with it for very long.</li>
</ul>
So there you have it, my preferences along with my very short descriptions.  Although I like for my desktop to stay stable, I may have to start hopping on one of my laptops again--I like to see what else is out there and what they all have to offer. I LOVE the sheer amount of choice that Linux and FOSS offer!

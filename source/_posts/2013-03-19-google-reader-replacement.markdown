As was announced not too long ago, [Google Reader is going away](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/17/focusing-on-the-google-reader-shutdown/), but luckily there [are many alternatives](http://lifehacker.com/5990881/five-best-google-reader-alternatives).
There are even many free & open source alternatives for RSS readers--and I think this number will greatly increase now.
In my opinion, the Goog closing down this project will spur innovation in an otherwise stale segment--and I think partially because of that, and partially because of the exodus, some people will discover some open source software that they love.

And that is always a good thing.  ... ([Obligatory link to stallman singing the software freedom song](http://youtu.be/9sJUDx7iEJw).)

Anyway, I heard/saw many recommendations for [Tiny Tiny RSS (tt-rss)](http://tt-rss.org/), and decided to give it a go on my newly setup VPS.
Installation went pretty smoothly because I already had most of the dependencies installed for [status.net](http://status.net).  I'm using [mariadb](http://mariadb.org/) instead of mysql, but it's a drop-in replacement.

Overall, I love it and so far I do not miss google reader at all.  I've already stopped using it, and have fully been using tt-rss running on my own server (which has the added benefit of allowing me to own/control my data).

There are a couple of things that bug me, but it is kind of foolish to complain too much about an open source project--you can always make changes or create your own project.

* It is written in PHP.  PHP used to be amazing, but now it's just a bloated language that is everywhere.  
* It requires mysql db!  It seems this could be done without the db (Given I haven't really thought about or looked into it).

Either way, many other solutions are out there and some are very different. Some are closed source.  
The main thing is, we can still get our RSS feeds without the goog.

and even better with some FREEDOM.

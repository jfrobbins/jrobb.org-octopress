I'm glad I am not the only one that feels this way about Google:

Since <a href="http://factorq.net/2010/02/22/making-backups/" target="_blank">my last topic</a> was backups, and today is Backup Awareness day, here is another post about: <a href="http://blog.i-no.de//archives/2010/02/24/index.html#e2010-02-24T20_31_15.txt" target="_blank">http://blog.i-no.de//archives/2010/02/24/index.html#e2010-02-24T20_31_15.txt</a>
This would be interesting to read from the beginning: <a href="http://lcorg.blogspot.com/2010/01/building-all-text-linux-workstation.html" target="_blank">"Building an all-text Linux workstation"</a>, current part is part 11.  I went back to find part 8 and then gave up, part 1 is back in time somewhere!

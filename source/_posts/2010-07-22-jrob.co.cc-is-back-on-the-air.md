A while back, I had <a href="http://factorq.net/2010/03/03/i-got-bored-so-creating-a-www-server/" target="_blank">made my own webserver</a>.  Recently as there had been a LOT of downtime with my (free) host...again...I decided I was just going to leave them and delete my account.  Didn't I set up Apache at home?  So I figured I would give it a go.  I set up the site, forwarded my ports, and had everything working.  Then, I started reading about how this can be dangerous, DOS/DDOS attacks and other things of the like.  I didn't really like that at all, so I started looking around for hosts.  My site is really simple with very little traffic, so if I'm paying for a host I don't want to be paying out the wazoo here.

 Then I came across <a href="http://nearlyfreespeech.net" target="_blank">nearlyFreeSpeech.net</a> ... the home of <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/services/pricing" target="_blank">"only pay for what you use"</a> hosting.  So far, so good. I haven't had very much experience with them, but it looks like it is a small outfit focusing on quality rather than ...whatever x10 focused on.  If it works out, I may end up moving this site over there as well.

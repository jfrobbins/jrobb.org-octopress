About [3 weeks ago](https://microca.st/jrobb/note/SX5erVM3S9SXaSiYTF9yQA) my VPS was hacked and the culprit decided for some reason to wipe data from the VPS nodes.
Who knows why, but it happened.  As a result, my server was wiped out and I've only just now been able to log back in and start setting some things back up.

I was depending on ChicagoVPS' offsite backups, however that was hoping too much.  It seems I've lost most things--my statusnet database, my pump database, any uploads associated with those.
I'll also have to re-setup ttrss and whatever else I will need running.  The good news is, I'm finally able to log in and do these things.  It's taken a really long time to get to this point.

For now, though, I'm going to take a break and get to bed.

Here are a few of the more notable communications from that time period:

This is a further status update to the recent security breach that ChicagoVPS has experienced. We have successfully restored some nodes, and the vast majority of our VPS customers are online, however we have a small percentage of nodes which still need to be worked on. Some of the nodes we are working on had data loss that we cannot restore. These nodes are LA18, ATL1, ATL4, ATL5. I you on are on one of these nodes you can safely start to rebuild, or open a ticket asking for this months refund.
    
On a positive note, it seems like SolusVM has released a new update in light of the recent incidents ( http://blog.soluslabs.com/2013/06/19/security-updates-available-for-all-solusvm-versions/ ). However, at this time we do not feel comfortable enabling SolusVM access at this minute as we were a victim of their security vulnerabilities two times in the past 7 months. We are evaluating other alternative panels, but at the moment our priority is taking care of our customers and getting the impacted nodes back in working order.
    
Please understand that we have all hands on deck working tirelessly to restore service connectivity for those impacted. Therefore, our ticket response times are affected to allow us to effectively work without anything slowing us down. We apologize for the delayed ticket response times but we assure you we are making progress and working hard to get everything back to normal.

Our goal is to have everything 100% restored tomorrow. Those affected by this incident will recieve compensation.
   
Regards,

ChicagoVPS Team

ChicagoVPS June 18th RFO Report #4


I just want to start off by saying thank you to everybody and their patience. I know this situation has been very frustrating and long, and I can assure you we are doing our best. We are still restoring VPS' via support ticket request. While doing this, we have noticed that a small percentage of the backups were corrupted after being restored. Those of you that are wondering why itâ€™s taking so long for us to get to your ticket, I wanted to clear that up. There are a lot of customers impacted and this is a very timely process and the ChicagoVPS team is going through them very carefully.

I want to state again that there will be compensation for all clients affected by the compromise. We would like to thank you again for your patience, and we are getting closer to getting everything back in working order.

Thank you,

The ChicagoVPS Team

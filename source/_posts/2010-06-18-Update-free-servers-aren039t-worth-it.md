on the old site which I just transferred from (again), the MySQL db's are all jacked up and non-working,so I am back here to stay.

 I've changed about the <a href="/code/">Code Page</a>, gave it a little more structure.  I have yet to try to recover the lost posts from the other host.  I imagine it is going to be quite the hassle.

 In fact, they may not even be recoverable, if the databases were wiped out!  doh!

 While <a href="http://X10hosting.com" target="_blank">X10hosting.com</a> did provide a good service at a great price, they were always overloaded, and as such always making upgrades.  this caused a LOT of downtime.  Finally, I'm just tired of it.

 Wish me some data recovery luck!

So The old host is back up. I am not really hosting any files there anymore, so it more or less just points here.

 I host a few things on there that warrant keeping it, but nothing high priority so it does not really matter if it goes down again.  Oh, and the MySQL db's are all broken, so I had to disable anything that tried to connect.  Lame!

I haven't really been updating as I would like to.  I've been kind of kicking around the idea of moving away from wordpress, and converting all of my existing posts to html so I can import them into my hl-- blog.  Then I will have more control of the domain and all of that. Besides, although wordpress is really feature rich and awesome...I think it is kind of bloated.  But it is also really easy.

 So, what's been going on.  <!--more-->
My first blood-nephew was born!  My brother's wife went into pre-term labor and some other stressful stuff, but now I have a nephew. Pretty cool.  I've got 3 kids, so maybe my brothers will start catching up to me now.  :-)

 Speaking of that, I don't remember if I mentioned it yet or not, but my 3rd kid / second daughter was born Oct 2nd.  :-D  and now that we have 3 kids under 3 yrs old, we are done for sure!  haha

 I got my rear axle for the jeep finally:  a C&amp;C 14bolt 1 ton. <a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_d4xnJM_h7n4/TLoI7nXE6HI/AAAAAAAAAZY/Fa2QEOAAahs/s640/IMG_20101016_140251.jpg"><img title="C&amp;C 14 bolt" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_d4xnJM_h7n4/TLoI7nXE6HI/AAAAAAAAAZY/Fa2QEOAAahs/s420/IMG_20101016_140251.jpg" alt="" /></a>
Today I am selling one of my guns, which is always a sad affair.  This particular one is a S&amp;W model 36 Chief's Special in .38 special, my only revolver currently.

It's sad that I'm selling it, but I'm getting a 1911 and a .22 rifle in it's place. I'd say that works out pretty well :-)

 That's about all I've got for everything that has been going on with me lately, needless to say it has been pretty hectic around here.

Over the weekend I had some time and then decided to do something I had always wanted to do:  create an http server.  I was using my desktop, which runs <a href="http://archlinux.org" target="_blank">Arch</a> of course,  and went through several of <a href="http://fqnet.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=nix&amp;action=display&amp;thread=56&amp;page=1" target="_blank">these links</a> and set my desktop up with Apache, PHP, and MySQL.  Also, I installed vsftp as an FTP server.

 I even signed up with <a href="http://dyndns.com">DynDNS</a> so that my dynamic IP can be updated to a (sub)domain and etc etc.

 Once I had everything set up and working--which turned out to be amazingly simple by the way--...I asked myself "to what end?"

 You know what, I don't know.  I guess just to do it.  I won't USE the webserver, being I use wordpress here (with a top-level domain for $9 a YEAR!  for a TLD at dynDNS it would be $30), and as long as it is flexible enough for me, I'll keep it.

 Also, I have my account at <a href="http://x10hosting.com">X10hosting</a> where my code site (<a href="http://jrob.co.cc">jrob.co.cc</a>) is hosted and I could use it instead of my own desktop--I'm sure it would be faster, more reliable, and have about the same flexibility.

 All-in-all, I think I could possibly use the FTP server, for backing up files and accessing them remotely.  But that is about it.

 I also thought about setting up an email server, but while possible, I don't think I would get much benefit out of it.  gmail does a pretty good job, with no maintenance from me (as much as I hate to admit, since google is taking over the world).

 It was a good experience, and I am glad that I did it--I may set up something similar (but dedicated) at work sometime in the future.  It's good knowing how to do something like that, whether or not there is a feasible application for it.

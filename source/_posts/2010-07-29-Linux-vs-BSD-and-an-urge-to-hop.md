So, my interest was peaked in BSD for some reason...I think maybe I saw a release (<a href="http://www.ghostbsd.org/" target="_blank">GhostBSD</a> perhaps), and I realized that I don't really know much about it.  I have briefly used <a href="http://www.pcbsd.org/" target="_blank">PC-BSD</a> (which is based on <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/" target="_blank">FreeBSD</a>) before while I was distro-hopping, but I did not get very extensive use out of it.

 I started searching for information about BSD and how it relates to (GNU/)Linux, which basically led me to this post:  <a href="http://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/bsd4linux/bsd4linux1.php" target="_blank">http://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/bsd4linux/bsd4linux1.php</a> -- This is a very good read, although it does not go into minute detail or anything, it covers some of the general aspects of how the two relate.

 As such, this has peaked my distro-hopping interest again...So I think I am going to give FreeBSD a go on my spare laptop.  I love <a href="http://archlinux.org" target="_blank">ArchLinux</a>, and FreeBSD seems similarly constructed/philosophied.  To a point.

 I also would like to check out the new <a href="http://www.sabayon.org/" target="_blank">Sabayon</a> Linux release--I really liked the past releases, and it appears recently they have made very good improvements.  Maybe I will do this in parallel with the BSD...
